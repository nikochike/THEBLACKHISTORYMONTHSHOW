      Sawsan Abdelmagid, Translator.
    </h1>
    <h3>
       <p class="example">Sawsan is a competent educator, translator and copy-editor willing to go the extra mile to inspire, motivate and challenge learners. 
        Of special importance to her is that every learnerâ€™s needs are met, and that learners are supported to reach their full potential. 
      
        Her translated and edited Arabic/English materials are flawless, exhibiting a high degree of linguistic and cultural competence, attention to detail, and understanding of the writing and reading experiences.</p> 
       <p class="example">She has crowned thirty years of teaching and learning in the MENA region (nineteen of which were Primary Years Programme - PYP) by 
        developing and producing an Arabic language six-volume curriculum for international native speakers approved by the Ministry of Education 
        and National Center for Curriculum & Educational Research Bakht-er-Rudah - Sudan. The books are developed with modern pedagogical methodologies 
        designed to motivate learners to develop critical thinking and communication skills through experiential engaging and enjoyable activities and games while learning 
        through and about the language.</p>
       <p class="example">Her first published book was nominated for the Sheikh Zayed Book Awards.</p>

       <p class="example">Sawsan is Sudenese.  She currently lives in Egypt, where she fled to soon after the war erupted in Khartoum in April 2023.</p>
