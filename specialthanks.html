    <p><em>Sawsan Abdelmagid, Translator</em>
    </p>

</h3>


<p>
  I am a competent educator, translator and copy-editor willing to go the extra mile to inspire, motivate and challenge learners. <br>
  Of special importance to me that every learnerâ€™s needs are met, and that learners are supported to reach their full potential. <br>

  My translated and edited Arabic/English materials are flawless, exhibiting a high degree of linguistic and cultural competence,<br>
   attention to detail and understanding of the writing and reading experiences.</p>
   <p>I crowned thirty years of teaching and learning in the MENA region (nineteen of which were Primary Years Programme - PYP) by <br>
    developing and producing an Arabic language six-volume curriculum for international native speakers approved by the Ministry of Education 
    and National Center for Curriculum & Educational Research Bakht-er-Rudah - Sudan. The books are developed with modern pedagogical methodologies 
    designed to motivate learners to develop critical thinking and communication skills through experiential engaging and enjoyable activities and games while learning <br>
    through and about the language.</p>
    <p>Published the first book My First Book (austinmacauley.ae) ISBN: 978-9-9487966-7-1 currently nominated for Sheikh Zayed Book Awards.<br>
      <p>Sawsan is Sudenese.  She currently lives in Egypt, where she fled soon after the war erupted in Sudan in April 2023.</p>

<p>
    A big thank you to<br>
    my favorite coach,<br>
    <b>Brian Lawrence</b>, for <br>
    demystifying the world  <br>
    of coding, github, and <br>
    visual studio code for me. </p>
<p>

    He reminded me of the <br>
    power of good teachers. <br> 
    They teach because they <br>
    love it and in the process,  <br>
    they change the world.<br>
